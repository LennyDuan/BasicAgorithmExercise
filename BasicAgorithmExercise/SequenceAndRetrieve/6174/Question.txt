Assuming there is a 4 digits number 'c' and each digits are different.
You can get number 'a' from sequece the number from big to small.
And get number 'b' from sequece the number from small to big.
Then use number 'a - b' to change 'c'. So 'c' = 'a - b'
And keep going the steps and u can get 6174 .

Sample Input :1234
Sample output: 1234 > 3087 > 8352 > 6174
