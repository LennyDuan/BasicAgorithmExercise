There is a Binary Tree and the deepest level is D and all the levels of trees are the same.
And the roots are numbered by 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 2^D -1 from top to down.
Put a ball at  root 1 and it will fall down. All the roots have a switch and are closed.
When a ball fall into a root the switch will change. If the switch is closed, ball goes left. Otherwise goes letf.

Some ball starts dropping from 1. Where is the last ball's position?
Input the deep level D and balls number I. Output the I ball's position. D <=20.

Sample Input : 4 2
               3 4
               10 1
               2 2 
               8 128
               16 12345
Sample output: 12
               7
               512 
               3
